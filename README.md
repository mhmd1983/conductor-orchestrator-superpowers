## What is this?

Conductor turns Claude Code into a **structured engineering team**. Instead of ad-hoc coding, it organizes work into tracks with specs, plans, parallel execution, and automated evaluation.

**One command. Full automation.**

```bash
/go Add user authentication with OAuth
```

That single command triggers the full lifecycle — spec, plan, execute, evaluate, fix — without any manual handoffs.

## What's Included

| Component | Count | Highlights |
|-----------|------:|------------|
| **Agents** | 16 | Orchestrator, loop agents, board directors, executive advisors, workers |
| **Skills** | 42 | Planning, execution, evaluation, debugging, TDD, code review |
| **Commands** | 22 | `/go`, `/conductor`, `/board-meeting`, `/cto-advisor`, and more |
| **Evaluators** | 4 | UI/UX, Code Quality, Integration, Business Logic |
| **Board of Directors** | 5 | Chief Architect, CPO, CSO, COO, CXO |
| **Lead Engineers** | 4 | Architecture, Product, Tech, QA |

Bundles [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) v4.3.0 (MIT) — no external dependencies.

---

## Installation

### Option 1: Plugin Marketplace (easiest)

```bash
/plugin marketplace add Ibrahim-3d/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers
/plugin install conductor-orchestrator-superpowers@ibrahim-plugins
```

### Option 2: Clone directly

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim-3d/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers.git ~/.claude/plugins/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers
```

### Option 3: Manual download

Download the latest release and extract to `~/.claude/plugins/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers/`.

### Verify

Start a new Claude Code session. Type `/` and check for `/go`, `/conductor:implement`, `/board-meeting` in the command list.

---

## VS Code Extension

Use Conductor directly from **GitHub Copilot Chat** in VS Code.

> **No Claude CLI required.** The extension is fully standalone — it needs only VS Code 1.95+ and the GitHub Copilot extension. It does not call `claude` or read any Claude Code configuration.

### Install

<p align="center">
  <a href="https://github.com/mhmd1983/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers/raw/main/vscode-extension/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers-3.3.0.vsix">
    <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-VSIX_3.3.0-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=visual-studio-code" alt="Download VSIX 3.3.0"/>
  </a>
</p>

**Option A — one-liner (requires VS Code CLI):**

```bash
curl -L -o conductor.vsix \
  https://github.com/mhmd1983/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers/raw/main/vscode-extension/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers-3.3.0.vsix \
  && code --install-extension conductor.vsix
```

**Option B — GUI:** Click the badge above to download the `.vsix`, then in VS Code open the Extensions panel, click `⋯ → Install from VSIX…`, and select the downloaded file.

**Option C — build from source:**

```bash
cd vscode-extension
npm install
npm run package   # produces conductor-orchestrator-superpowers-3.3.0.vsix
code --install-extension conductor-orchestrator-superpowers-3.3.0.vsix
```

### Usage

Open the Copilot Chat panel (`Ctrl+Shift+I` / `Cmd+Shift+I`) and use the `@conductor` participant:

```
@conductor /init                          # initialize workflow in current project
@conductor /go Add Stripe payments        # start a new track
@conductor /status                        # view track registry
@conductor /plan Refactor auth layer      # generate a plan template
@conductor /review                        # run quality-gate checklist
```

Or use the **Command Palette** (`Ctrl+Shift+P`):

- **Conductor: Initialize Project** — creates the `conductor/` directory structure and `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Conductor: Show Status** — opens `conductor/tracks.md` in Markdown preview

See [`vscode-extension/README.md`](vscode-extension/README.md) for full details.

---

## Quick Start

**1. Initialize Conductor in your project:**

```bash
/conductor:setup
```

Creates a `conductor/` directory with track registry, workflow docs, and knowledge base.

**2. Build something:**

```bash
/go Add Stripe payment integration with webhooks
/go Fix the login bug where users get logged out after refresh
/go Build a dashboard with real-time analytics charts
/go Refactor the database layer to use connection pooling
```

**3. Monitor and control:**

```bash
/conductor:status          # See all tracks and progress
/conductor:implement       # Continue work on current track
/conductor:new-track       # Create a track manually
/phase-review              # Run quality gate evaluation
```

---

## The Evaluate-Loop

Every track follows a rigorous, automated cycle:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/evaluate-loop.png" alt="Evaluate-Loop: Plan → Evaluate Plan → Execute → Evaluate Execution → Fix/Complete" width="700"/>
</p>

| Step | What Happens |
|------|-------------|
| **Plan** | Generates implementation steps with dependency graph (DAG) |
| **Evaluate Plan** | Checks scope, overlap with existing tracks, feasibility |
| **Execute** | Implements code, runs tests, updates progress |
| **Evaluate Execution** | Dispatches specialized evaluators (UI/UX, code quality, integration, business logic) |
| **Fix** | Addresses failures, loops back to evaluation (max 3 cycles) |
| **Complete** | All evaluators pass — track marked done |
| **Retrospective** | Extracts reusable patterns and error fixes to knowledge layer |

The loop runs **fully automated**. It stops when the track is complete, when the fix cycle exceeds 3 iterations, or when it needs human input.

---

## Parallel Execution

Tasks without dependencies run simultaneously via DAG scheduling:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/parallel-execution.png" alt="Parallel execution DAG showing tasks running simultaneously" width="700"/>
</p>

The orchestrator reads the dependency graph and dispatches independent tasks to parallel worker agents. When all upstream dependencies resolve, downstream tasks start automatically.

---

## Board of Directors

For major architectural and strategic decisions, a 5-member board deliberates across 5 phases:

<p align="center">
  <img src="assets/board-of-directors.png" alt="Board of Directors: Chief Architect, CPO, CSO, COO, CXO around a decision table" width="700"/>
</p>

| Director | Domain | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Chief Architect** | Technical | System design, patterns, scalability, tech debt |
| **Chief Product Officer** | Product | User value, market fit, scope discipline |
| **Chief Security Officer** | Security | Vulnerabilities, compliance, data protection |
| **Chief Operations Officer** | Operations | Feasibility, timeline, resources, deployment |
| **Chief Experience Officer** | Experience | UX/UI, accessibility, user journey |

Each director independently assesses, then they discuss and vote with written rationale.

```bash
/board-meeting Should we migrate from REST to GraphQL?
/board-review Add real-time notifications via WebSocket
```

### Track structure (created per project)

When you run `/conductor:setup`, it creates:

```
your-project/
└── conductor/
    ├── tracks.md               # Track registry
    ├── workflow.md             # Process documentation
    ├── authority-matrix.md     # Decision boundaries
    ├── decision-log.md         # Architectural decisions
    ├── knowledge/
    │   ├── patterns.md         # Learned patterns
    │   └── errors.json         # Error-fix registry
    └── tracks/
        └── feature-name/
            ├── spec.md         # Requirements
            ├── plan.md         # Implementation plan + DAG
            └── metadata.json   # State machine + config
```

## Project-Specific Skills

Conductor handles orchestration. Your project handles domain knowledge. Keep project-specific skills in `.claude/skills/`:

```
your-project/.claude/skills/
├── product-rules/SKILL.md       # Business logic, personas
├── api-patterns/SKILL.md        # API conventions
├── design-system/SKILL.md       # Design tokens, components
└── testing-standards/SKILL.md   # Coverage targets, test patterns
```

The orchestrator loads both plugin skills and project skills automatically.

---

## FAQ

### How much context does this plugin use?

Skills use **progressive disclosure** — only ~100 tokens per skill for metadata scanning. Full instructions load only when a skill activates (typically <5k tokens each). In practice, a `/go` session loads the orchestrator skill (~4k tokens) plus whichever evaluator/planner is active at that step. Inactive skills stay dormant. The 42 skills are **not** all loaded at once.

Commands (slash commands) add zero context until invoked. Agents run as **subprocesses with their own context windows**, so they don't consume your main conversation's context.

**Estimated overhead per step:**

| Step | Context Added | Notes |
|------|--------------|-------|
| Orchestrator | ~4k tokens | Always active during `/go` |
| Planner | ~3k tokens | Active during planning only |
| Evaluator | ~2-3k tokens each | Only active evaluator loads |
| Board meeting | ~5k tokens | On-demand, not part of default loop |
| Idle (between steps) | ~500 tokens | Metadata only |

### Does this work with Gemini CLI, Trae, Cursor, or other AI tools?

**Short answer:** No. This is a Claude Code plugin that uses Claude Code's plugin system (agents, skills, slash commands, hooks). It cannot run in Gemini CLI, Trae, Cursor, Windsurf, or other tools — they have different architectures and APIs.

**However**, the underlying concepts are portable:
- The `conductor/` directory it creates in your project (specs, plans, track registry) is just Markdown files. Any AI tool can read them.
- If you start a project with Conductor and later switch tools, your specs and plans remain useful documentation.
- The Evaluate-Loop pattern (plan → evaluate → execute → evaluate → fix) is a workflow methodology, not locked to any runtime.

### Do I need Claude CLI to use the VS Code extension?

**No.** The VS Code extension is **completely standalone**. It only requires VS Code 1.95+ and the GitHub Copilot extension — no `claude` CLI, no Claude Code installation, no Anthropic account needed for the extension itself. GitHub Copilot provides the AI responses inside VS Code.

The VS Code extension scaffolds the `conductor/` project structure and writes `.github/copilot-instructions.md` so Copilot understands the Evaluate-Loop workflow. All actual AI work is done by GitHub Copilot, not by Claude Code.

### What does this cost in API credits?

Conductor uses the same Claude API calls you'd make manually — it just structures them. Multi-agent orchestration does mean **more API calls** because:
- Each agent subprocess is a separate conversation
- Evaluation steps add calls you might skip manually
- Board meetings use 5+ parallel agent calls

**Rough multiplier:** A `/go` session for a medium feature uses roughly **3-5x** the API calls of doing it manually. You're trading credits for structure, quality gates, and reduced rework.

**Ways to reduce cost:**
- Use `/conductor:implement` (skips spec generation if you write your own)
- Skip board meetings for small features (they're opt-in via `/board-meeting`)
- Use Sonnet or Haiku for the model where possible (agent model selection respects your Claude Code config)

### Which Claude models does this work with?

All of them. The plugin works with whatever model you've configured in Claude Code (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku). Agents inherit the parent model by default, but the orchestrator can dispatch to specific models when appropriate (e.g., Haiku for simple tasks, Opus for complex evaluation).

### Is this overkill for small projects?

For a one-file script or a quick fix — yes, skip it. Use Conductor when:
- The feature touches 3+ files
- You'd normally spend time planning before coding
- You want automated quality checks before shipping
- You're building something that needs to be right the first time

You can also use individual commands without the full loop:
```bash
/board-review Should we use Redis or Memcached?   # Just get board input
/cto-advisor                                       # Just get architecture review
/write-plan                                        # Just create a plan
```

### Can I use this alongside other Claude Code plugins?

Yes. Conductor coexists with any other plugin. It doesn't override built-in commands or conflict with other plugin namespaces. Your other plugins' slash commands, agents, and MCP servers remain fully available during Conductor sessions.

### How do I uninstall or disable it?

```bash
# Disable without removing
/plugin          # Toggle off in the plugin menu

# Full removal
rm -rf ~/.claude/plugins/conductor-orchestrator-superpowers
```

The `conductor/` directory in your project persists after uninstall — it's just Markdown files that serve as documentation regardless.
